Backup-TA (unofficial Linux port)
=================================

This is an unofficial Linux port of the Backup-TA tool for Sony Xperia smartphones.

Check the original [https://github.com/DevShaft/Backup-TA] and (XDA Thread)[http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2292598]
for more information.

More work is needed, but so far it should work with no problems to backup (restore needs a lot
more testing). If possible, use the Windows version to be on the safe side.
